            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) bottle McCormick Red Food Color</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons McCormick Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the vanilla cream cheese frosting:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, <em>softened</em></li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, <em>softened</em></li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sour cream</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons McCormick Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) box confectioners' sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 30 muffin cups with paper liners.</li>
            <li>Make cake: Mix together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time.</li>
            <li>Mix in sour cream, milk, food color, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Gradually beat in flour mixture on low speed until just blended; do not over-beat. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
                Remove cupcakes from the pans; cool completely.</li>
            <li>While cupcakes are cooling, make frosting: Beat cream cheese, butter, sour cream, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until light and fluffy.
                Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until smooth.</li>
            <li>Spread or pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes.</li>
        </ol>
